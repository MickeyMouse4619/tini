1.Addition of two 8 bit numbers having 16 bit sum.
Algo:

1. Start the program.
2. Load the first data in the accumulator.
3. Initialize the carry with zero.
4.Move value at memory to the accumulator.
5.Now load value of second data.
6.Add content at Memory and accumulator and store it in Accumulator.
7.If the carry is “0” then store the result which is specified.
8.If the carry is “1” then increment the C register and store the result.
9.Stop the program.
Program:
// ADDITION OF TWO 8 BIT NUMBERS HAVING 16 BIT SUM
// Manually strore 1st no in the memory location C050
// Manually store 2nd no in the memory location C051
// Result is stored in C052, & C053
# BEGIN 0000H
	   LXI H,C050
	   MVI C,00
	   MOV A,M
	   INX H
	   ADD M
	   JNC AHEAD
	   INR C
