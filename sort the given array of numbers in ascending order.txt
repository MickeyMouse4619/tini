7.	Write a 8085 program to sort the given array of numbers in ascending order.
   Algo:
1. Get the numbers to be sorted from the memory locations.
2.Compare the first two number and if the first  number is larger than second than interchange the number.
3.If the first number is smaller go to step 4.
4.Repeat the step 2 and 3 until the numbers are in  required  order.

Program:
  LXI H,C050      
          MOV C,M      
          DCR C         
  REPEAT: MOV D,C 
          LXI H,C051 
    LOOP: MOV A,M      
          INX H 
          CMP M 
          JC SKIP       
          MOV B,M      
          MOV M,A      
          DCX H         
          MOV M,B      
          INX H        
    SKIP: DCR D        
          JNZ LOOP     
          DCR C         
          JNZ REPEAT    
          HLT          
# ORG C051H
# DB 12H,05H,06H,08H
