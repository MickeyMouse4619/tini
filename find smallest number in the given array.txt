6.	Write a 8085 program to find smallest number in the given array of numbers.
  Algo:
1. Place the elements of an array in consecutive memory locations.
2. Fetch the first element from the array.
3. Initialize a counter (register) with the total number of elements in an array.
4. Decrement the counter by 1.
5. Increment the memory pointer to point to the next element.
6. Compare the accumulator content with the memory content (next element).
7. If the accumulator content is smaller, then move the memory content (smallest element) to the accumulator. Else continue.
8. Decrement the counter by 1.
9. Repeat steps 5 to 8 until the counter reaches zero
10. Store the result (accumulator content) in the specified memory location.
Program:
// Smallest number in an array
# BEGIN 0000H
	   LXI H,C050
	   MVI C,0A
	   MOV A,M

LABEL:	   CMP M
	   JC LOOP
	   MOV A,M

LOOP:	   INX H
	   DCR C
	   JZ LABEL1
	   JMP LABEL

LABEL1:	   STA C060
	   HLT
# ORG C050H
# DB 06H,07H,08H,09H,10H,11H,12H,13H,14H,15H
