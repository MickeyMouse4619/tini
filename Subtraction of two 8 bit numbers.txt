2.	Subtraction of two 8 bit numbers (Single program should satisfy the following cases)

Case:1 When minuend is greater than subtrahend
Case 2: When minuend is smaller than subtrahend.
Algo:
1. Start the program.
2. Load the first data in the accumulator.
3. Initialize the carry with zero.
4.Move value at memory to the accumulator.
5.Now load value of second data.
6.Sub content at Memory and accumulator(M-A) and store it in Accumulator.
7.If the carry is “0” then store the result which is specified.
8.If the carry is “1” then increment the C register and store the result.
9.Stop the program.
Program:
//8 BIT SUBSTRACTION
# BEGIN 0000H
	   LXI H,C050
	   MVI C,00
	   MOV A,M
	   INX H
	   SUB M
	   JNC AHEAD
	   INR C

AHEAD:	   STA C053
	   MOV A,C
	   STA C052
	   HLT

# ORG C050
# DB 08H,03H
