3.	Multiplication two 8 bit numbers, result is 16 bit number.
Algo:
1. Start the program.
2. Load the first data in the accumulator.
3.Move value at Accumulator to C.
4.Load the second data in the accumulator.
5.Move value at Accumulator to B.
6.Now clear accumulator by moving 00 to accumulator.
7.Create a loop in which the second data is added with itself to get multiplication of two numbers upto no. of second data. i.e. if the number is 5 and 2 then we have to add 2 to 2 for 5 times ,2+2+2+2+2=10.
8.Store the data.
9.Stop the program.
Program:
# BEGIN 0000H
	   LDA C050H
	   MOV C,A
	   LDA C051H
	   MOV B,A
	   MVI A,00H

LOOP:	   ADD B
	   DCR C
	   JNZ LOOP
	   STA C052H
	   MVI A,00H
	   JNC LABEL
	   INR A

LABEL:	   STA C053H
	   HLT
// multiplication of two numbers
# ORG C050
# DB 05H,02H
