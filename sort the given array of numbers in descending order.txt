8.	Write a 8085 program to sort the given array of numbers in descending order.
    Algo:
1. Get the numbers to be sorted from the memory locations.
2.Compare the first two number and if the first number is smaller than second than interchange the number.
3.If the first number is smaller go to step 4.
4.Repeat the step 2 and 3 until the numbers are in  required  order.

Program:
# BEGIN 0000H
	   LXI H,C050
	   MOV C,M
	   DCR C

REPEAT:	   MOV D,C
	   LXI H,C051

LOOP:	   MOV A,M
	   INX H
	   CMP M
	   JNC SKIP
	   MOV B,M
	   MOV M,A
	   DCX H
	   MOV M,B
	   INX H

SKIP:	   DCR D
	   JNZ LOOP
	   DCR C
	   JNZ REPEAT
	   HLT
# ORG C051H
# DB 01H,04H,06H,08H,02H
